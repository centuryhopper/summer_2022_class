We have discussed human factors and cyber.  The following principles - perception, decision making, action selection, and training - have been developed in research and provide a basis for analyzing the factors affecting cyber-related decisions.

Choose one of the four principles and discuss the importance and relevance to cybersecurity in general and also describe how the four affect each other in your own words.






I firmly believe the most important factor is training because if you didn't receive proper training will not be equipped well enough to perceive potential scams you see online and therefore make potentially wrong decisions that would make you fall victim to such things. In other words, the other three factors (i.e. perception, decision making, and action selection) are heavily dependent on the amount of training you receive from somewhere, whether that is your own past experiences, going to school, or learning from a victim of a scam you know of.


Following proper training, you would have the proper perception to how to act and not to act. Perception builds upon training and past experiences. For example, if you lost some money gambling (experience) and you later recall on the classic saying "the house always wins" and the odds that you would win anything big (training), you would know not to go down that path for getting rich (perception and your final decision). If you didn't receive those training, then you would have a higher chance of choosing to keep gambling until you win something big and likely end up losing everything. In the context of cybersecurity, it's the same. If you've seen examples of the differences between scams and the real deal, then you are better equipped of evading by making the right decisions at the right time. This is especially true if you have been scammed before and know better with what you're up against.
